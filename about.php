            <p class="about__p">I am a Korean based in &#128205;Calgary, Canada.<br>I possess a high level of
                motivation and skill. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of
                different methodologies and visual hierarchies &#128218; in the field of design and development. Seeking
                feedback from fellow colleagues and mentors is a priority for me &#128293; as it allows me to
                continuously refine my skills and deliver superior results in my work. Additionally, my previous
                experience has equipped me with exceptional time management skills and attention to detail &#128300;,
                enabling me to collaborate effectively in fast-paced and diverse environments. As a member of a team or
                organization, I am passionate about bringing my unique blend of experience and expertise to the table.
