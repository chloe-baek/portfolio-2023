            <p class="about__p-first">My name is Chloe Jewon Baek and I aspire to become a frontend
                developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about__p">I
                completed the New Media Production and Design program at SAIT where I learned HTML, CSS,
                Javascript,
                PHP, and WordPress. In addition, I have been studying Javascript and React through online
                courses in
                my spare time. During the 4 semesters of my program and in practicum, I worked on various
                projects
                and discovered my passion for web development.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about__p">I believe that a good developer creates designs and
                functions that are easy for users to use and
                always strives to think from the target user's perspective. I am eager to become a new developer
                who
                can fully immerse myself in solving small problems for users rather than focusing solely on
                impressive achievements.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about__p"> I hope that you will believe in my potential for growth and lead me in
                the
                right direction.</p>
