            <p class="about__p">Korean based in Calgary, Canada, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and exploring
                new frameworks and libraries to enhance my skills. In this constantly evolving field, I strive to

            <!-- <p class="about__p">I believe that a good developer creates designs and
                functions that are easy for users to use and
                always strives to think from the target user's perspective. I am eager to become a new developer
                who
                can fully immerse myself in solving small problems for users rather than focusing solely on
                impressive achievements.</p>

            <p class="about__p"> I hope that you will believe in my potential for growth and lead me in
                the
                right direction.</p> -->
